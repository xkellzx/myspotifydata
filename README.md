After requesting my data from Spotify, I decided to play around a bit with the streaming history data files by creating visualizations in Tableau.

The first visualization showcases which artists I listen to the most as the area covered by a single color represents a singular artist. Furthermore, it can be seen which songs of that artist I listen to the most, which corresponds to the area of the box representing a song. Hovering over a box will show the artist name, track name, and number of streams. 

The second visualization displays the number of streams per month from May 2021 to May 2022. Like the previous visualization, every artist is represented by one color. In the dashboard, you can click on any box from the first visualization to filter what shows up on the second visualization. This allows you to see how many streams per month there were for the specific song box you chose. Otherwise, when left on default without filtering, you can see an overview of what songs were played the most each month over the past year.

It is important to know that I have filtered the data so that only songs with a total of at least 50 streams can be included.
